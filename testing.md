# Testing

## Test 1 - 15-07-2021

### Feature to be tested: print guessed word status
One of the more complicated features of the application is that which hides the word to be guessed and reveals the guessed letters. I have been testing this as I wrote my code, but I have not yet tested it on a word with letters that repeat, such as "letters".

### Outline
I will run the game in 2 player mode, so that I can enter a word of my choosing. When gameplay commences, I will enter letters I know to be repeated, and observe the outcome.

### Case test A: "Letters
Letters appeared as expected.

### Case test B: "AAABBBAAACCCC"
Letters appeared as expected.

### Outcome
This particular feature of the application ran as expected. I did encounter other bugs, however. These included the play again feature, which does not work as expected, and the placement of the "you won" message. Because this appears above the snowflakes ascii art, which is quite large, it moves too easily out of view.
