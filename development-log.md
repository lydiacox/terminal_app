Having completed my Software Development Plan, I have commenced writing code. I am tracking my outstanding tasks in Asana, because it is software I am already comfortable with, and I have enough new programs to learn as it is. All my outstanding tasks, including blocks of code, are tracked in Asana with deadlines, priorities and tags. I have exported these tasks to Excel, but I do not want to be tracking my process on two platforms, so intend to keep Asana up to date with status and notes.

The first code I wrote was the ascii art for the snowmen. Once I'd created the first snowman, it was easy to recreate my melting snowman. I don't think my puddle looks much like a puddle, but it will do.

While I did find this process fun, the bulk of my work writing the code will be the game play, so in the interest of saving time, I copied word art for the welcome screen and snowflakes for the game win screen. I have credited these websites in notes in my code.

I also created a small "dictionary" (actually just a list, not a dictionary in the Python sense) of words to use in the game. I stuck to nouns to keep it simple. No one wants a game where you have to guess "the".

My next step will be to write sudo code to get the overall structure of my code right.
