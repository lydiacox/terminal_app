Having completed my Software Development Plan, I have commenced writing code. I am tracking my outstanding tasks in Asana, because it is software I am already comfortable with, and I have enough new programs to learn as it is. All my outstanding tasks, including blocks of code, are tracked in Asana with deadlines, priorities and tags. I have exported these tasks to Excel, but I do not want to be tracking my process on two platforms, so intend to keep Asana up to date with status and notes.

The first code I wrote was the ascii art for the snowmen. Once I'd created the first snowman, it was easy to recreate my melting snowman. I don't think my puddle looks much like a puddle, but it will do.

While I did find this process fun, the bulk of my work writing the code will be the game play, so in the interest of saving time, I copied word art for the welcome screen and snowflakes for the game win screen. I have credited these websites in notes in my code.

I also created a small "dictionary" (actually just a list, not a dictionary in the Python sense) of words to use in the game. I stuck to nouns to keep it simple. No one wants a game where you have to guess "the".

My next step will be to write sudo code to get the overall structure of my code right.

I have written more than half of the code I'd planned on. I needed assistance getting my head around while loops, but once I had a better understanding of them, the rest of the code was much easier to write.

There are two features which are giving me a lot of grief. The first is clearing the terminal between turns, which is happening at the wrong moments and making it difficult/impossible to read the messages I'd typed up. The second is having spaces allowed in the words. Checking the entry is a valid a-z is easy, adding a space is more complicated. As these features are not strictly necessary for the game to function, I will take them out for now. If I have time at the end, I'll add them back in.
