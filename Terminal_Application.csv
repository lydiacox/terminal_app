- you significantly change a feature or your implementation plan at any point

- encounter a significant issue, challenge or roadblock
- are halfway through implementing the features
- prior to / after testing the application

You should submit these logs throughout the course of developing your application.

Each status report should be between 100 - 200 words.

The Development Log should be written in markdown and placed in a file named development-log.md in the root of your source control repository. Ensure you put the date of the log at the top of each log entry.

Please send your log to your educator as a markdown file as you complete them. This is so we can provide you with feedback.",Terminal Application,,High

- prioritising tasks

You must submit screenshots, or a valid export from a project management application to satisfy this requirement. If you are using a non-standard project management application, please discuss with your trainer whether they can access the file.

- creating a wrapper script which turns the application into an executable
- and/or creating a script which performs the tests you have specified in your design document
A good mark can be achieved by executing either of these two options in a sophisticated fashion. For maximum marks, attempt both.

You must submit a script file in with your source control repository to satisfy this requirement.",,Developer Operations,High
